PCW Normally you would set minlim to 0 and maxlim and scale to the spindle
speed at full voltage
 
 
<pcw-home> on the spindle configuration, note that 7I96S,7I76,7I76E,7I47S all need to use the -abs command
<pcw-home> since they have 0 to 10V (unipolar) outputs
<pcw-home> also if using the spindle  PID as a feedthrough (no encoder feedback used)
P should be 0
<pcw-home> Otherwise the scaling will be wrong (2x too high output)

<pcw-home> No need for the abs component, motion already exports and absolute spindle speed pin
<pcw-home> spindle.0.speed-out-abs

pid.4.output => abs.0.in => abs.0.out => hm2_7i96s.0.pwmgen.00.value


<pcw-home> Actually I realize that only the 7I76 requires the absolute spindle
speed (the others use the PWMgen which is sign-magnitude so OK with signed speeds)
